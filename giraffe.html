                   <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements.</p>
                    
                   <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
                    
                   <p>Giraffes are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs,forests and marshes.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the giraffe at pen E36, right after the lost forest.</p>
