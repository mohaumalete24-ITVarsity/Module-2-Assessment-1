                   <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear,is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the redpanda, a neighboring musteloid.</p>
                    
                   <p>The black ears may signal aggressive intent, while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another. The giant panda's thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.</p>
                    
                   <p>Pandas are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including bamboo trees,forests and marshes.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the pandas at pen E40, right in the lost forest.</p>
